# Kaliqlabs Website

This repo contains the code for the **Kaliqlabs** corporate site. It’s a clean, fast, modern front-end that represents our global team and the kind of systems we build: scalable, high-performance, and practical.

## Vision

The site is built to feel modern from the first scroll: dark theme, neon gradients, subtle motion, and a straightforward layout. Everything is modular React for easy updates, and the entire UI is fully responsive across devices.

## Stack

We use tools that prioritize speed and a smooth developer experience.

- **React** for a modular, maintainable UI  
- **Vite** for fast builds and instant dev feedback  
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for quick, consistent styling  
- **Lucide React** for clean, modern icons  

## Getting Started

You only need **Node.js (v18+)** installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kaliqlabs/kaliqlabs-web.git
